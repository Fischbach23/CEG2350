## namechange Usage Guide

Examples of script usage and output. This should be enough info that  
you can hand this and the script to someone not in this course and they  
would be able to understand what your script does and how to use it.

- The script takes the name of a file and replaces with a user provided name. To run the script you use ./namechange -f `filename` -r replace `desired filename`. The user can also use -h to see the usage of the script and options.
