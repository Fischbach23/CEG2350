## Lab Procedure

The focus of this lab is exploring your system. You will be creating a `Lab06.md` file for your work in this lab. To create and edit the file, you are welcome to use your AWS instance (or anywhere your repo is cloned) or edit the file directly in the browser.

In your repository (the folder named `ceg2350-yourgithubusername`):

Create a new directory, `Lab06`

Create a file named `Lab06.md` [based on the template](LabTemplate.md).

## System Discovery

Find out the following information about your personal system. Write the answers to the information requested. Part of this is learning about your system, so some info will not apply to your system (because of how your OS works with your hardware or your system's hardware). Provide confirmation of your findings where possible.

For the GPU section, you may only have one or the other.  Only fill out what you have.

- You can use the manufacturers website / manuals
- You can post to our course Discord channel for help / hints
  - On \_\_ OS, how are you finding \_\_?
- You should _not_ need to install additional programs to find this information. If someone tells you to install something, run away.

1. CPU info:
    - CPU brand:
    - Number of cores:
    - Number of logical cores:
2. GPU info:
    - Integrated GPU info:
    - Dedicated GPU info: 
    - Link to driver for primary GPU: 
3. Memory info:
    - Physical memory (RAM) size (translate to GB)
    - Virtual memory size (translate to GB)
      - Some systems will call virtual memory a pagefile
4. Storage info (for each disk attached to your system): 
    - Disk type:
    - Disk manufacturer and model:
    - Total disk size (translate to GB):
5. Primary partition info:
    - Primary partition mount point:
      - `C` for Windows users
      - `/` for Linux / Mac(?) users
    - Remaining space on primary partition (translate to GB):
    - Filesystem on primary partition:
6. BIOS / UEFI info: 
    - BIOS or UEFI version: 
    - How to access your BIOS / UEFI:
7. Bootloader running on your system: 
8. Kernel version of your operating system:

## Extra Credit - Install a VM Manager

This is to take some headache out of Lab 07 by having you install VirtualBox now - you do **NOT** need to create a virtual machine, *yet* - that's for Lab 07. It is recommended to get done this week in case there are any new surprises. If you have trouble, post to the class chat in Discord so I / the TAs / your classmates can help out.

You will need a computer that has CPU virtualization enabled. The lab machines & open lab machines in Russ are all good candidates (and may have VirtualBox already installed). For your own machine, you may need to enable CPU virtualization in your BIOS / UEFI.

- Windows, Linux, Mac users:
  - [Download and install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  - Pick your host OS when installing
    - For example, Windows users should select "Windows hosts")
- Mac M1 & M2 Users:
  - VirtualBox _should_ work now, but just in case:
  - Install either:
    - Parallels - Wright State offers a student discount on Parallels
      - [Get Parallels via the Hub](https://www.wright.edu/information-technology/software-purchases-for-personal-use)
      - [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) - free if you click "Download". You can support the developers by paying through the App Store.
- Windows 11 Users:
  - Try to install VirtualBox, but it has had mixed support in Windows 11
  - [Enable Hyper-V Manager](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-virtualization-in-windows-11/)
- Chromebook Users:
  - You may need to use one of the open labs (320 OH during lab time, or Russ 152 B or D) or be prepared to use a different system you have access to.
 
For credit, you will need to provide two things:
- The name of the Virtual Machine Management software you will use (have installed)
- A screenshot proving that you installed it to your system and you can open the software.
  - Reminder - creating the virutal machine is for Lab 07, not here.

## Submission

1. Verify that your GitHub repo has a `Lab06` folder with at minimum:

   - `Lab06.md`

2. In the Pilot Dropbox, paste the URL to the `Lab06` folder in your GitHub repo
   - URL should look like: https://github.com/WSU-kduncan/ceg2350-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/tree/main/Lab06

## Rubric

- Each bullet point + P1 q7 & q8 = 1 point -> 18 pts total
- Extra credit - 5% = 0.9 pts
